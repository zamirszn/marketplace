When user taps Make Payment:

Call /orders/{id}/make_payment/ (backend prepares payment session â†’ e.g. Paystack/Flutterwave/Stripe link).

Frontend redirects user to payment gateway UI (browser overlay/webview/SDK).

Either redirect back to app with payment reference, OR

Webhook notifies backend and frontend polls /orders/{id}/ for updated payment_status.

UI now updates:

Payment Status = Paid

Order Status = Pending (waiting for admin to fulfill).

Once admin/store processes order:

order_status changes â†’ Completed (delivered) or Failed (canceled).

Frontend order list & details update automatically.
